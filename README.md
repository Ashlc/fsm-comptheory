# How to run this app?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### This guide assumes you already have Node.js installed on your machine.

In the project directory, before your first launch, you'll have to run the following command:

### `npm install`

This will install any dependencies needed to run the app locally. Then you'll use the following script:

### `npm start`

It runs the app in the development mode.\
